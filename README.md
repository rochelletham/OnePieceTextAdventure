# One Piece Text Adventure
This project was originally for a UIUC class: Software Design Studio (CS 126). I had fun creating my own json file which generally followed the plotline of the anime, One Piece. The player is Luffy and his dream is to travel around the world to obtain the world's greatest treasure, One Piece, to ultimately become the Pirate King. During the journey, the player will meet all kinds of people and discover exciting islands. 

Disclaimer: the directions taken to each island in the game are directions I arbitrarily mapped out -- though I did try my best to ensure that the directions to each island were relative to one another. 

## Skills
- Java, Java unit tests
- JSON

## To run:
I run the project on IntelliJ IDEA and set the run target to "Main.java". After that, the game should be running in the console or terminal!

## To play:
A list of directions you can take are displayed each time you press `Enter` in the console. 
1. For each direction, you must start with `go`. For example, you can enter the following: `go east`. Any entered direction which is not one of the provided options will result in an error message, and the player will remain on the current island. 
2. If you'd like to read the current island's situation again, press `enter`.
3. Have fun and thanks for playing my game!!
